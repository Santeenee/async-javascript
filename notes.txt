One of the most important part of JavaScript

I will be using async JS at some point while crafting web projects

Used to perform tasks that take some time to complete
(getting data from DB)

first understand synchronous code..
{
  every statement execute after the other (in a single threaded environment --> JS)

  if at some point, you fetch some data from a DB, you stop the program (until you get the data ofc) --> "blocking code"
}

this is solved letting the browser handle the request of data while your code is doing stuff, then, when the data is fetched, a callback function is called and it finishes what the original function wanted to do. kinda.

"Start something now & finish it later"
